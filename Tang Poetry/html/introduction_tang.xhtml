                This project mainly focuses on relationship network reflected in Tang poems. The project aims to find the most popular poets in early Tang dynasty. Titles of 1500 poems were randomly selected from volume 1-5 and 30-185 of Quan
                Tangshi. Majority of the poets were living before or around 750BC, which is the year that divides Tang dynasty into early and later periods. Finally, 878 of 
                the poems have peopleâ€™s names mentioned. On the relationship network of early Tang dynasty, there are 769 nodes (including poets and people mentioned) and 
                900 edges (or links). <br/><br/>
                On the foundation of network analysis, the project also did spatial analysis. We try to discover the role that poets' personal experience played in their relationship cycle. We chose the biggest nodes as samples.
