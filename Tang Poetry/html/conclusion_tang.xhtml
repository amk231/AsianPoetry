                Data: Amount of Each Group of Component / Total Amount of Components
            </p>
            <p>Names in Tang poems usually appear as combinations. We identified nine components of names: surname, given name, title, location, family ranking, kinship,
                faming, zhi and zi. The chart above shows proportion of each component. Surname is the most popular one. Title is the second popular one. The leading two components are
                far ahead of the rest of the components.

                We identified 32 kinds of name combination in Tang poems. The most popular combination is title and surname. The second one is comprised of a single component—zhi, which is 
                an honorific title for emperors. However, it means that this combination is specifically used between officials and emperors. The third one is surname and given name. By comparing 
                this chart with the chart above, we found that title with surname is a very important combination. The reasons that the combination is popular are: first, the coombination 
                can refer to anyone precisely; second, avoiding the usage of given name is more polite. Therefore, singly using surname is favored.

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Inclination</h2>
            <p>
                Provincial officials, court officials, poets and people from royal family were four major contributors of relationship in Tang poems. Court officials initiated 480
                interactions, provincial officials initiated 190 interactions, poets initiated 177 interactions and royal familly initiated 17 interactions. To understand the 
                class of people that each group frequently interacted with, we made this chart. </p>

            <p>
                We can draw several conclusions by analyzing the chart:</p>
                <p>First, court officials played an important role in Tang poetry. Court offcials are always one of the most frequently mentioned population among the four 
                groups. </p>
                <p>Second, different social background had different religious inclination. It seems that provincial officials favored Daoism more than Buddhism; court officials favored Buddhism more than Daoism;
                royal family was extremely passionate to Daoism. </p>
                <p>Third, the boundary between provincial officials and court officials is fluid. Provincial officials and court offcials interacted frequently and mutually. It shows that there
                is not a solid boundary that restricts the interaction of life in capitals and in provinces. But we found that provincial officials had no interaction with local officials,
                but court officials had. It is a strange phenomenon. It may suggest that provincial government was controlled by the central government, but the provincial government didn't 
                had tight control of local administrations, because they were isolaed from local officials' daily life.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>We compared poets' personal experience with hometown, living places and related places of the people that they interacted with. The result shows that poets'
        personal experience had strong impact on the location of people that they interacted with. However, court officials may not. </p>
