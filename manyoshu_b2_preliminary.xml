            <context>Longing for the Emperor Nintoku.</context>
            <l>Since you, my Lord, were gone,</l>
            <l>Many long, long days have passed.</l>
            <l>Should I now come to meet you</l>
            <l>And seek you beyond the mountains,</l>
            <l>Or still await you--await you ever ?</l>
            <l>Rather would I lay me down</l>
            <l>On a steep hill's side,</l>
            <l>And, with a rock for pillow, die,</l>
            <l>Than live thus, my Lord,</l>
            <l>With longing so deep for you.</l>
            <l>Yes, I will live on</l>
            <l>And wait for you,</l>
            <l>Even till falls</l>
            <l>On my long black wav1ng hair</l>
            <l>The hoar frost of age.</l>
            <l>How shall my yearning ever cease—</l>
            <l>Fade somewhere away,</l>
            <l>As does the mist of morning</l>
            <l>Shimmering across the autumn field</l>
            <l>Over the ripening grain?</l>

            <l>One may find no sheltering bay,</l>
            <l>One may find no sequestered lagoon.</l>
            <l>O well if there be no bay!</l>
            <l>O well if there be no lagoon!</l>
            <l>Upon Watazu's rocky strand,</l>
            <l>Where I travel by the whale-haunted sea,</l>
            <l>The wind blows in the morning,</l>
            <l>And the waves wash at eve</l>
            <l>The sleek sea-tangle and the ocean weed,</l>
            <l>All limpid green.</l>
            <l>Like the sea-tangle, swaying in the wave</l>
            <l>Hither and thither, my wife would cling to me,</l>
            <l>As she lay by my side.</l>
            <l>Now I have left her, and journey on my way,</l>
            <l>I look back a myriad times</l>
            <l>At each turn of the road.</l>
            <l>Farther and farther my home falls behind,</l>
            <l>Steeper and steeper the mountains I have crossed.</l>
            <l>My wife must be languishing</l>
            <l>Like drooping summer grass.</l>
            <l>I would see where she dwells—</l>
            <l>Bend down, O mountains!</l>
            <l>Envoys</l>
            <l>From between the trees that grow</l>
            <l>On Takatsunu's mountain-side</l>
            <l>In the land of Iwami</l>
            <l>I waved my sleeve to her--</l>
            <l>Did she see me, my dear wife?</l>
            <l>The leaves of bamboo grass</l>
            <l>Fill all the hill-side</l>
            <l>With loud rustling sounds;</l>
            <l>But I think only of my love,</l>
            <l>Having left her behind.</l>
            <l>In the sea of Iwami, </l>
            <l>By the cape of Kara, </l>
            <l>There amid the stones under sea</l>
            <l>Grows the deep-sea miru weed;</l>
            <l>There along the rocky strand</l>
            <l>Grows the sleek sea-tangle.</l>
            <l>Like the swaying sea-tangle,</l>
            <l>Unresisting would she lie beside me--</l>
            <l>My wife whom I love with a love</l>
            <l>Deep as the miru-growing ocean.</l>
            <l>But few are the nights</l>
            <l>We two have lain together.</l>
            <l>Away I have come, parting from her</l>
            <l>Even as the creeping vines do part.</l>
            <l>My heart aches within me;</l>
            <l>I turn back to gaze--</l>
            <l>But because of the yellow leaves</l>
            <l>Of Watari Hill,</l>
            <l>Flying and fluttering in the air,</l>
            <l>I cannot see plainly</l>
            <l>My wife waving her sleeve to me.</l>
            <l>Now as the moon, sailing through the cloud rift</l>
            <l>Above the mountain of Yakami,</l>
            <l>Disappears, leaving me full of regret,</l>
            <l>So vanishes my love out of sight;</l>
            <l>Now sinks at last the sun,</l>
            <l>Coursing down the western sky.</l>
            <l>I thought myself a strong man,</l>
            <l>But the sleeves of my garment</l>
            <l>Are wetted through with tears.</l>
            <l>My black steed</l>
            <l>Galloping fast,</l>
            <l>A way have I come,</l>

            <l>Leaving under distant skies</l>
            <l>The dwelling-place of my love.</l>
            <l>Oh, yellow leaves</l>
            <l>Falling on the autumn hill,</l>
            <l>Cease a while</l>
            <l>To fly and flutter in the air</l>
            <l>That I may see my love's dwelling-place</l>
