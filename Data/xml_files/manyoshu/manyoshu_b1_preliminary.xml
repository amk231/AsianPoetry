            <context>When the Emperor Tenji commanded Fujiwara
            Kamatari, Prime Minister to judge between the luxuriance
            of the blossoms on the spring hills and the glory of the
            tinted leaves on the autumn hills, Princess Nukada decided
            the question with this poem.</context>
            <l>When, loosened from the winter's bonds,</l>
            <l>The spring appears,</l>
            <l>The birds that were silent</l>
            <l>Come out and sing,</l>
            <l>The flowers that were prisoned</l>
            <l>Come out and bloom;</l>
            <l>But the hills are so rank with trees</l>
            <l>We cannot seek the flowers,</l>
            <l>And the flowers ate so tangled with weeds</l>
            <l>We cannot take them in our hands.</l>
            <l>But when on the autumn hill-side</l>
            <l>We see the foliage,</l>
            <l>We prize the yellow leaves,</l>
            <l>Taking them in our hands,</l>
            <l>We sigh over the green ones,</l>
            <l>Leaving them on the branches;</l>
            <l>And that is my only regret--</l>
            <l>For me, the autumn hills!</l>

            <l>I would go lingering over its sight,</l>
