            <context>When the Emperor Tenji commanded Fujiwara Kamatari, Prime
                Minister to judge between the luxuriance of the blossoms on the spring hills and the
                glory of the tinted leaves on the autumn hills, Princess Nukada decided the question

                <l>The spring appears,</l>
                <l>The birds that were silent</l>
                <l>Come out and sing,</l>
                <l>The flowers that were prisoned</l>
                <l>Come out and bloom;</l>
                <l>But the hills are so rank with trees</l>
                <l>We cannot seek the flowers,</l>
                <l>And the flowers ate so tangled with weeds</l>
                <l>We cannot take them in our hands.</l>
                <l>But when on the autumn hill-side</l>
                <l>We see the foliage,</l>
                <l>We prize the yellow leaves,</l>
                <l>Taking them in our hands,</l>
                <l>We sigh over the green ones,</l>
                <l>Leaving them on the branches;</l>
                <l>And that is my only regret--</l>

                <l>Along the coast of Tsunu</l>
                <l>On the sea of Iwami</l>
                <l>One may find no sheltering bay,</l>
                <l>One may find no sequestered lagoon.</l>
                <l>O well if there be no bay!</l>
                <l>O well if there be no lagoon!</l>
                <l>Upon Watazu's rocky strand,</l>
                <l>Where I travel by the whale-haunted sea,</l>
                <l>The wind blows in the morning,</l>
                <l>And the waves wash at eve</l>
                <l>The sleek sea-tangle and the ocean weed,</l>
                <l>All limpid green.</l>
                <l>Like the sea-tangle, swaying in the wave</l>
                <l>Hither and thither, my wife would cling to me,</l>
                <l>As she lay by my side.</l>
                <l>Now I have left her, and journey on my way,</l>
                <l>I look back a myriad times</l>
                <l>At each turn of the road.</l>
                <l>Farther and farther my home falls behind,</l>
                <l>Steeper and steeper the mountains I have crossed.</l>
                <l>My wife must be languishing</l>
                <l>Like drooping summer grass.</l>
                <l>I would see where she dwells—</l>
                <l>Bend down, O mountains!</l>
                <envoy>
                <l>From between the trees that grow</l>
                <l>On Takatsunu's mountain-side</l>
                <l>In the land of Iwami</l>
                <l>I waved my sleeve to her--</l>
                <l>Did she see me, my dear wife?</l>
                <l>The leaves of bamboo grass</l>
                <l>Fill all the hill-side</l>
                <l>With loud rustling sounds;</l>
                <l>But I think only of my love,</l>
                <l>Having left her behind.</l>
                <l>In the sea of Iwami, </l>
                <l>By the cape of Kara, </l>
                <l>There amid the stones under sea</l>
                <l>Grows the deep-sea miru weed;</l>
                <l>There along the rocky strand</l>
                <l>Grows the sleek sea-tangle.</l>
                <l>Like the swaying sea-tangle,</l>
                <l>Unresisting would she lie beside me--</l>
                <l>My wife whom I love with a love</l>
                <l>Deep as the miru-growing ocean.</l>
                <l>But few are the nights</l>
                <l>We two have lain together.</l>
                <l>Away I have come, parting from her</l>
                <l>Even as the creeping vines do part.</l>
                <l>My heart aches within me;</l>
                <l>I turn back to gaze--</l>
                <l>But because of the yellow leaves</l>
                <l>Of Watari Hill,</l>
                <l>Flying and fluttering in the air,</l>
                <l>I cannot see plainly</l>
                <l>My wife waving her sleeve to me.</l>
                <l>Now as the moon, sailing through the cloud rift</l>
                <l>Above the mountain of Yakami,</l>
                <l>Disappears, leaving me full of regret,</l>
                <l>So vanishes my love out of sight;</l>
                <l>Now sinks at last the sun,</l>
                <l>Coursing down the western sky.</l>
                <l>I thought myself a strong man,</l>
                <l>But the sleeves of my garment</l>
                <l>Are wetted through with tears.</l>

                    <l>Falling on the autumn hill,</l>
                    <l>Cease a while</l>
