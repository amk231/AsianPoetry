            <h1>Corpus Selection</h1>
            <p> The Nara corpus was created through the collection of 100 poems from four of the twenty total books in the Manyoshu.
                Books I, II, IV, and VIII were chosen due to the balanced nature of the contributing authors' genders. Twenty poems 
                were arbitrarily selected from Book I, II, and VIII. Forty poems were chosen from Book IV because of its greater size
                and closest ratio of male to female authors. The result of the gender distribution of the chosen poems was as follows:

            <h2>Mark Up</h2>
            <p>
                The structural mark up for the Nara portion of the project is organized by book and further by poem number. In some 
                cases within the Manyoshu multiple poems were provided as a single paragraph. For the sake of accuracy we preserved 
                this structure except when the poems were written by different authors. Even poems within the same paragraph 
                contribute to the total number of poems. The texts of the selected poems were marked up with special attention given
                to specific names and places. Attributes describing the sex and role were applied to the names and attributes 
                describing region, type, and coordinates were applied to locations. Using these tags we were able to create the,
                albeit small, network analysis illustrating the communication between authors.
