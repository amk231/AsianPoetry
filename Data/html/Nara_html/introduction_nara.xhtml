                <p class="space"> The Manyoshu, translated as the Collection of Myriad Leaves, is the oldest
                    existing anthology of Japanese poetry. It is believed to have been compiled by
                    the poet and court official Otomo no Yakamochi around the 8th Century during the
                    Nara Period (710-794 A.D.). The collection is divided into twenty separate books
                    with over 4,500 poems composed by a variety of authors, both male and female
                    with roles ranging from soldiers to monks to members of the Imperial family. The Manyoshu
                    embraces both Imperial and common, urban and rural, imtimately revealing the strata of medieval Japanese society.
                    The topics covered within the Manyoshu are sufficiently varied, with a range much wider than what is found in other Japanese
                    poetry anthologies, using topics that may have been considered unacceptable by
                    court poets in later periods.</p>
                  <p class="space"> This project seeks to analyze the relationships between poets, assuming some may
                    be found, from within the Manyoshu itself as well as in relation to the poets of
                    the Chinese poetry anthology, the Quan Tangshi. Comparisons of these two works
                    will illustrate possible cultural and social differences between Japan and China
                    during this time and provide us with a more coherent network of relations and
                    communications between the two. In addition, we plan to investigate whatever social, political, and cultural information that
                   can be extracted from our digital exploration of the text.</p>
