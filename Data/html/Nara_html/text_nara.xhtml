                  Hither and thither, my wife would cling to me,<br /> As she lay by my side.<br />
                  Now I have left her, and journey on my way,<br /> I look back a myriad times<br />
                  At each turn of the road.<br /> Farther and farther my home falls behind,<br />
                  Steeper and steeper the mountains I have crossed.<br /> My wife must be

                  Takatsunu's mountain-side<br /> In the land of Iwami<br /> I waved my sleeve to
                  her--<br /> Did she see me, my dear wife?<br /> The leaves of bamboo grass<br />
                  Fill all the hill-side<br /> With loud rustling sounds;<br /> But I think only of
                  my love,<br /> Having left her behind.<br /> In the sea of Iwami,<br /> By the
                  cape of Kara,<br /> There amid the stones under sea<br /> Grows the deep-sea miru
                  weed;<br /> There along the rocky strand<br /> Grows the sleek sea-tangle.<br />
                  Like the swaying sea-tangle,<br /> Unresisting would she lie beside me--<br /> My
                  wife whom I love with a love<br /> Deep as the miru-growing ocean.<br /> But few
                  are the nights<br /> We two have lain together.<br /> Away I have come, parting
                  from her<br /> Even as the creeping vines do part.<br /> My heart aches within
                  me;<br /> I turn back to gaze--<br /> But because of the yellow leaves<br /> Of
                  Watari Hill,<br /> Flying and fluttering in the air,<br /> I cannot see
                  plainly<br /> My wife waving her sleeve to me.<br /> Now as the moon, sailing
                  through the cloud rift<br /> Above the mountain of Yakami,<br /> Disappears,
                  leaving me full of regret,<br /> So vanishes my love out of sight;<br /> Now sinks
                  at last the sun,<br /> Coursing down the western sky.<br /> I thought myself a
                  strong man,<br /> But the sleeves of my garment<br /> Are wetted through with
                  tears.<br /> My black steed<br /> Galloping fast,<br /> A way have I come,<br />
                  My black steed<br /> Galloping fast,<br /> Away have I come,<br /> Leaving under
