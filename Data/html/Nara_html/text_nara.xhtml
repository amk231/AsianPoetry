            <p>Your basket, with your pretty basket,<br /> Your trowel, with your little
               trowel,<br /> Maiden, picking herbs on this hill-side,<br /> I would ask you: Where
               is your home?<br /> Will you not tell me your name?<br /> Over the spacious Land of
               Yamato<br /> It is I who reign so wide and far,<br /> It is I who rule so wide and
               far.<br /> I myself, as your lord, will tell you<br /> Of my home, and my name.</p>
            <h3 id="2">2: Emperor Jomei</h3>
            <p>Countless are the mountains in Yamato,<br /> But perfect is the heavenly hill of
               Kagu;<br /> When I climb it and survey my realm,<br /> Over the wide plain the
               smoke-wreaths rise and rise,<br /> Over the wide lakes the gulls are on the
               wing;<br /> A beautiful land it is, the Land of Yamato!</p>
            <h3 id="3-4">3-4: Empress Kogyoku</h3>
            <p>Hear the twang of the mid-strings<br /> Of his royal birchwood bow,<br /> Which my
               Sovereign, ruling in peace,<br /> Loves to handle at break of day,<br /> And fondly
               leans against with dusk.<br /> Now he must be out for his morning hunt,<br /> Now he
               must be out for his evening chase;<br /> I hear the twang of the mid-string<br /> Of
               his loved birchwood bow! With horses drawn abreast<br /> On the open waste of
               Uchi,<br /> This morning he must be trampling<br /> That grassy land!</p>
            <h3 id="5-6">5-6: Prince Ikusa</h3>
            <p>Not knowing that the long spring day-<br /> The misty day-is spent,<br /> Like the
               'night-thrush';I grieve within me,<br /> As sorely my heart aches.<br /> Then across
               the hills where our Sovereign sojourns,<br /> Luckily the breezes blow<br /> And turn
               back my sleeves with morn and eve,<br /> As I stay alone;<br /> But, being on a
               journey, grass for pillow,<br /> Brave man as I deem me,<br /> I know not how to cast
               off<br /> My heavy sorrows;<br /> And like the salt-fires the fisher-girls<br /> Burn
               on the shore of Ami,<br /> I burn with the fire of longing<br /> In my heart. Fitful
               gusts of wind are blowing<br /> Across the mountain-range,<br /> And night after
               night I lie alone,<br /> Yearning for my love at home.</p>

            <p>Mount Kagu strove with Mount Miminashi<br /> For the love of Mount Unebi.<br /> Such
               is love since the age of the gods;<br /> As it was thus in the early days,<br /> So
               people strive for spouses even now. When Mount Kagu and Mount Miminashi
               wrangled,<br /> A god came over and saw it<br /> Here-on this plain of Inami!<br />
               On the rich banner-like clouds<br /> That rim the waste of waters<br /> The evening
               sun is glowing,<br /> And promises to-night<br /> The moon in beauty!</p>

            <p>When, loosened from the winter's bonds,<br /> The spring appears,<br /> The birds
               that were silent<br /> Come out and sing,<br /> The flowers that were prisoned<br />
               Come out and bloom;<br /> But the hills are so rank with trees<br /> We cannot seek
               the flowers,<br /> And the flowers ate so tangled with weeds<br /> We cannot take
               them in our hands.<br /> But when on the autumn hill-side<br /> We see the
               foliage,<br /> We prize the yellow leaves,<br /> Taking them in our hands,<br /> We
               sigh over the green ones,<br /> Leaving them on the branches;<br /> And that is my
               only regret--<br /> For me, the autumn hills!</p>

            <p>O That sweet mountain of Miwa--<br /> I would go lingering over its sight,<br />
               Many times looking back from far upon it<br /> Till it is hidden beyond the hills of
               Nara<br /> And beyond many turnings of the road;<br /> Then should the clouds be
               heartless<br /> And conceal the mountain from me? Must they veil Mount Miwa so?<br />
               Even clouds might have compassion;<br /> Should ye, O clouds,conceal it from me?</p>

            <p>Obedient to our mighty Sovereign's word,<br /> I left my long-loved home,<br /> And

               At each of the eighty windings of the river;<br /> And benighted on the stream I
               reached<br /> The River Saho flowing through Nara;<br /> There from my couch I could
               see,<br /> Clearly in the bright moonlight of dawn,<br /> The night-frost lying like
               a sheet of linen<br /> And the river bound with ice as if with rocks.<br /> Often on
               such a freezing night, loyal to my duties,<br /> I paddled down to build the
               mansion,<br /> Where I hope my lord will live<br /> For a thousand ages,<br /> And
               that I too may journey here for as long. I shall come to the mansion of Nara<br />

               heaven and earth<br /> Help you till you reach your home!</p>
            <h3 id="557">557: Hanishi Mitoshi</h3>
            <p>As we go fast, rowing the huge ship,<br /> Should she hit the rocks and
               overturn--<br /> Oh, let her overturn! I shall not mind<br /> Since it is for my dear
               wife's sake.</p>
            <h3 id="559-560">559-560: Otomo Momoyo</h3>
            <p>I have lived my life<br /> In peace and quiet-<br /> Ah, that I should
               encounter<br /> Now in my declining years<br /> Love such as this!</p>

            <p>When I shall have died of love—<br /> What can avail me then?<br /> I crave again to
               see you<br /> While I live, dear lady.</p>
            <h3 id="571">571: Otomo Yotsuna</h3>
            <p>Beautiful is the moon-lit night,<br /> And clear the voice of the river.<br /> Here
               let all of us make merry—<br /> You who go and we who remain!</p>
            <h3 id="573">573: Manzei</h3>
            <p>Even after my locks,<br /> Black as the berries of pardanthus,<br /> Have all turned
               white,<br /> There comes a time when I must nurse<br /> Heart-aching love, alas!</p>
            <h3 id="574">574: Otomo Tabito</h3>
            <p>Here in the capital I wonder<br /> Where may be your land of Tsukushi--<br /> It
               must lie, alas! my friend,<br /> Far beyond the mountains<br /> Where white clouds
               hover.</p>
            <h3 id="594">594: Lady Kasa</h3>
            <p>In the loneliness of my heart <br /> I feel as if I should perish<br /> Like the
               pale dew-drop<br /> Upon the grass of my garden<br /> In the gathering shades of
               twilight.</p>
            <h3 id="596">596: Lady Kasa</h3>
            <p>Even the sands uncounted of a long beach<br /> That takes eight hundred days to
               travel—<br /> Could they at all outnumber<br /> My thoughts of love,<br /> O guardian
               of the isle on the sea?</p>
            <h3 id="600">600: Lady Kasa</h3>
            <p>Oh how steadily I love you--<br /> You who awe me<br /> Like the thunderous
               waves<br /> That lash the sea-coast of Ise!</p>
            <h3 id="602-605">602-605: Lady Kasa</h3>
            <p>More sad thoughts crowd into my mind<br /> When evening comes; for then<br />
               Appears your phantom shape--<br /> Speaking as I have known you speak.</p>

            <p>IF it were death to love, <br /> I should have died--<br /> And died again<br /> One
               thousand times over.</p>

            <p>I dreamed I was holding <br /> A double-edged sword close to my body--<br /> What
               does it foretell? It tells<br /> That I shall meet you soon.</p>

            <p>IF the gods of heaven and earth <br /> Were bereft of reason,<br /> I might die<br />
               Without seeing you<br /> Whom I love so well.</p>
            <h3 id="607-608">607-608: Lady Kasa</h3>
            <p>The bells are tolling, <br /> Bidding all to rest.<br /> But you being for ever on
               my mind,<br /> I cannot sleep.</p>

            <p>To love you who love me not<br /> Is like going to a great temple<br /> To bow in
               adoration<br /> Behind the back of the famished devil.</p>
            <h3 id="632">632: Prince Yuhara</h3>
            <p>What can I do with you--<br /> You who so resemble<br /> The lautel in the
               moon<br /> That I see with my eyes<br /> But cannot touch with my hands?</p>
            <h3 id="650">650: Otomo Miyori</h3>
            <p>You seem to have lived, my lady,<br /> In the Land of Eternity.<br /> You have grown
               younger<br /> Than when so many years ago<br /> I saw you last.</p>
            <h3 id="670">670: Prince Yuhara</h3>
            <p>By the light of the Moon God<br /> Come to me, dear heart!<br /> No mountain walls
               divide us—<br /> The way is not long.</p>
            <h3 id="671">671: Anonymous</h3>
            <p>Though clear and bright<br /> The Moon God lights the way,<br /> So blind am I with
               love,<br /> I feel I cannot reach you.</p>
            <h3 id="709">709: Oyakeme</h3>
            <p>In the twilight darkness<br /> Indistinguishable is the road.<br /> Wait till the
               moon-rise, and go,<br /> That I may see you, my dearest,<br /> Even for that while!</p>
            <h3 id="710">710: Ato Tobira</h3>
            <p>Once--only once,<br /> I saw him in the light<br /> Of the sky-wandering moon;<br />
               Now I see him in my dreams.</p>
            <h3 id="711">711: Taniha Ome</h3>
            <p>Here where the wild ducks<br /> Sport in the pond,<br /> The leaves fall from the
               trees<br /> And float-but no floating heart<br /> Have I who love you true.</p>
            <h3 id="718-719">718-719: Otomo Yakamochi</h3>
            <p>Having seen your smile <br /> In a dream by chance,<br /> I keep now burning in my
               heart<br /> Love's inextinguishable flame.</p>

            <p>How I waste and waste away <br /> With love forlorn--<br /> I who have thought
               myself<br /> A strong man!</p>
            <h3 id="722">722: Otomo Yakamochi</h3>
            <p>Rather than that I should thus pine<br /> for you,<br /> Would I had been
               transmuted<br /> Into a tree or a stone,<br /> Nevermore to feel the pangs of love.</p>
            <h3 id="728">728: Otomo Yakamochi</h3>
            <p>Would there were a land<br /> Uninhabited by man!<br /> Thither I'd take my
               love,<br /> And happily we twain would live.</p>
            <h3 id="731">731: Lady Otomo of Sakanoe's Elder Daughter</h3>
            <p>What do I care if my name<br /> Be on the tongues<br /> Of five hundred, or a
               thousand, men!<br /> Only should your name get abroad<br /> I would regret it and
               weep.</p>
            <h3 id="741">741: Otomo Yakamochi</h3>
            <p>What pain and distress<br /> A dream tryst brings!<br /> I start and wake,<br /> And
               grope in vain for you,<br /> Beyond the reach of my hand.</p>
