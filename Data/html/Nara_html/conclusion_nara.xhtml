                    The above graph illustrates the range of roles the authors played in their lives,
                    indicating how common, or uncommon, each role was in the corpus. Many of the roles
                    were marked up as unknown for one of two reasons, in the instance of an Anonymous 
                    author or when no surviving information regarding the authors role could be found.

                    This graph explores the occurence of location types thorughout the Manyoshu. In 
                    the case of the "unknown" location, this merely means that the location no longer
                    exists or was referred to by an unclear name within the poem. Locations were mainly
                    recorded within the context of the story as opposed to within the poems themselves,
                    instead indicating where from and where to the poet or person addressed was headed.
                    Other instances of location include whenever the author spoke about the place within
                    their poetry. This is the case in the great number of mountain reference occurences.
